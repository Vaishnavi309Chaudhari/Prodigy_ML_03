### Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs SVM Project
#### Overview: This repository features the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The project explores the application of SVMs in handling high-dimensional image data, emphasizing feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and parameter optimization.

#### Dataset: The training archive comprises 25,000 images of dogs and cats. The project focuses on training the SVM model using these files to enable accurate classification. Subsequently, the trained model predicts labels for test1.zip, differentiating between dogs (1) and cats (0).

### Technologies Used:

#### Python: Programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
#### Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating SVM models.
#### Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
#### Jupyter Notebook: Interactive platform for running Python code and documenting the project.
