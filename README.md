### Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs SVM Project
#### Overview: This repository features the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The project explores the application of SVMs in handling high-dimensional image data, emphasizing feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and parameter optimization.

#### Dataset: The training archive comprises 25,000 images of dogs and cats. The project focuses on training the SVM model using these files to enable accurate classification. Subsequently, the trained model predicts labels for test1.zip, differentiating between dogs (1) and cats (0).
